Machine Learning is a field of artificial intelligence where systems learn patterns from data instead of being explicitly programmed.

Supervised learning uses labeled data to learn mappings from inputs to outputs.

Unsupervised learning discovers hidden patterns in unlabeled data.

Natural Language Processing enables machines to understand and generate human language.

Large language models generate text by predicting the next token based on context.
