Machine Learning is a field of artificial intelligence where systems learn patterns from data instead of being explicitly programmed.

Supervised learning uses labeled data, meaning the correct output is known during training.

Unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns in data without labeled outputs.

Natural Language Processing is a branch of AI focused on understanding and generating human language.

Large language models generate text by predicting the next word based on context.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation allows a model to answer questions using external documents instead of relying only on memory.
